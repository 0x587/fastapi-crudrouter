## [v0.5.0 - Pagination](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter/releases/tag/v0.5.0) { .releases } 
2021-03-07
### üéâ Highlights
With the release of v0.5.0 all CRUDRouters  **now supports pagination** . All "get all" routes now accept `skip` and `limit` query parameters allowing you to easily paginate your routes.  By default, no limit is set on the number of items returned by your routes.  Should you wish to limit the number of items that a client can request, it can be done as shown below.

```python
CRUDRouter(
    schema=MyPydanticModel, 
    paginate=25
)
```

Check out the [docs](https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com/pagination/) on pagination for more information!

Tired of rewriting the same generic CRUD routes? Need to rapidly prototype a feature for a presentation or a hackathon? Thankfully, fastapi-crudrouter has your back. As an extension to the APIRouter included with FastAPI, the FastAPI CRUDRouter will automatically generate and document your CRUD routes for you.

**Documentation**: <a href="https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com" target="_blank">https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com</a>

**Source Code**: <a href="https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter" target="_blank">https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter</a>


### Installation
```python
pip install fastapi_crudrouter
``` 

### Usage
Below is a simple example of what the CRUDRouter can do. In just ten lines of code, you can generate all the crud routes you need for any model. A full list of the routes generated can be found here.
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_crudrouter import MemoryCRUDRouter as CRUDRouter

class Potato(BaseModel):
    id: int
    color: str
    mass: float

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(CRUDRouter(model=Potato))
```

### Features
- Automatic pydantic model based route generation and documentation ([Docs](https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com/routing/))
- Ability to customize any of the generated routes ([Docs](https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com/routing/#overriding-routes))
- Authorization and FastAPI dependency support ([Docs](https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com/dependencies/))
