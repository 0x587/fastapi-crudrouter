## Basic Usage
Below is a simple example of what the CRUDRouter can do. In just ten lines of code, you can generate all 
the crud routes you need for any model.  A full list of the routes generated can be found [here](./routing).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_crudrouter import MemoryCRUDRouter as CRUDRouter

class Potato(BaseModel):
    id: int
    color: str
    mass: float

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(CRUDRouter(model=Potato))
```

## OpenAPI Support

!!! tip "Automatic OpenAPI Documentation"
    By default, all routes generated by the CRUDRouter will be documented according to OpenAPI spec.

Below are the default routes created by the CRUDRouter shown in the generated OpenAPI documentation.
